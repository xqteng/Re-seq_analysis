####Ambiquity codes are codes that mean any of the two or any of the three nucleotides. Normally, purine (R, A or G) is complemented into pyrimidine (Y, C or T) and amino (M, C or A) is complemented into keto (K, T or G). Differently, weak (W, A or T, pairs with the two hydrogen bonds) and strong (S, G or C, pairs with three hydrogen bonds) are normally not swapped during complementation, leaving the S and W codes unchanged instead. This is logical as both a nucleotide and its complement use the same number of bonds to make a complementing pair. See this, for instance. Here is the complete table of our converter:
